# Here Be Dragons

This tool does what I need it to do, and might or might not try to do anything else. I'm publishing its source code under CC0 for anyone who might want to make something remotely similar in form or function to things I did for it, and seeks a working way, that might or might not be the best or the cleanest, to do so. This code is provided without any support, and without any plans to accept bug reports, feature requests or contributions.
